Excitonium is a simple interactive 3D web app of the solar system, developed by Team Excitonium for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. This project marks our first hackathon debut, offering users an engaging and interactive experience to explore the solar system in real time. A key feature of the app is a speed slider that lets users adjust the speed of planetary orbits, enhancing the exploration experience.


Features
Interactive 3D Solar System: Explore a fully interactive 3D model of the solar system, with planets orbiting the Sun dynamically.
Speed Control Slider: Adjust the speed of the planetary orbits using a slider, allowing users to slow down or accelerate the motion of the planets.
WebGL & Three.js Rendering: Built with Three.js and powered by WebGL, offering high-quality 3D graphics and smooth rendering in the browser.
Vite for Fast Development: Uses Vite for fast development and optimized production builds, ensuring quick load times and efficient performance.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, providing a seamless user experience across different platforms.
Technologies Used
Node.js: Backend framework for serving the application.
Vite: Modern build tool for rapid development and fast production builds.
Three.js: JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics and animations in the browser using WebGL.
JavaScript (ES6+): Core scripting language for implementing app functionality, animations, and user interaction.
HTML5: Structure of the web application.
CSS3: Styling for the user interface, including the layout and speed slider.
This project was developed by Team Excitonium during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. It represents our first foray into hackathon development, and we aimed to create a visually captivating, interactive educational tool that allows users to explore the solar system in an intuitive and fun way.
